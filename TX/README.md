Jasper contains campaign finance data for Texas state and local candidates; for federal (Senate, House of Representatives), look at fec.gov.

The whole database is available at this link: https://www.ethics.state.tx.us/tedd/TEC_CF_CSV.zip. As of 2018-05-14, this ZIP archive was 448MB. Record layouts: https://www.ethics.state.tx.us/tedd/CFS-ReadMe.txt, as well as the ReadMe.txt within the archive. It appears to be updated about once per quarter.

Individual candidates' campaign finance data is available as paged Excel documents. There are various measures to prevent automated downloads.

Go into "Simple Search" and select "By Filer Name" to find the candidate number. Some candidates are filed under a nickname instead of their legal first name, so search by last name if you don't find them at first.

Use the candidate's Filer ID to run an Advanced Search.

Choose between Contributions and Expenditures, then Filer ID as the Search Type, then the Date Type, then either the range or the year.

Finally, fill in the Filer ID and choose the Filer Type (available from the Simple Search done to get the Filer ID). Most individual candidates are COH, except for judicial candidates, who are JCOH.

Optional: fill in additional search criteria.
